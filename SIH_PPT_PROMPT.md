# SIH PPT — 6-slide Prompt for BinLink (ready-to-copy)

This file contains concise, slide-ready bullet content for a 6-slide PDF submission (title slide included). Keep bullets short — no long paragraphs — per SIH guidelines.

Slide 1 — Title Page
- Project: BinLink — Smart Bin Segregation & Monitoring
- Problem Statement ID: [fill in]
- Team Name: [Your Team]
- Category: Software

Slide 2 — Proposed Solution (Describe your Idea / Prototype)
- IoT + Mobile + Cloud: smart lid sensors + mobile app + Supabase backend
- Real-time monitoring of bin fill %, lid state, and segregation compliance
- Automated owner feedback + admin reports + predictive fill forecasting
- Novelty: combines per-bin segregation feedback with municipal analytics

Slide 3 — Technical Approach
- Stack: Next.js (TS), Supabase (Postgres + Realtime), Leaflet, Nodemailer
- Hardware: low-cost lid/open sensors (magnetic or ultrasonic), optional camera for segregation validation
- Flow: sensor → Supabase (bin_metrics) → realtime UI + email alerts + AI assistant
- Predictive model: daily-aggregates → lightweight moving-average forecast (server-side)

Slide 4 — Feasibility & Implementation Plan
- Phase 1: Prototype UI + sensors + Supabase ingestion (2 weeks)
- Phase 2: Alerts, admin dashboard, email reports, filtering by private/public (2 weeks)
- Phase 3: Predictive charts, AI assistant grounding, pilot with 50 bins (3 weeks)
- Risks: sensor connectivity, data privacy; mitigations: retries, minimal PII storage, RLS rules

Slide 5 — Impact & Benefits
- Improved segregation compliance → reduces landfill and increases recycling efficiency
- Municipal dashboards to prioritize collections and enforcement
- Scalable: works for both household (private) and community bins (public)
- Environmental + economic benefits (reduced transport & processing costs)

Slide 6 — Research & References
- Swachh Bharat Mission Urban 2.0 (segregation data)
- Example hardware: low-cost ultrasonic sensor docs
- Repo: (link to GitHub) — include instructions to run demo

Tips for exporting:
- Keep each slide as concise bullets (no paragraphs)
- Use simple diagrams or icons where helpful (sensor → cloud → dashboard)
- Export as PDF and upload to SIH portal
